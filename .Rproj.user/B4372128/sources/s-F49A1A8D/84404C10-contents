filtered_count_matrix.mtx - includes the gene-cell count matrix for 17926 genes and 70634 cells after QC filtering.
filtered_gene_row_names.txt - includes gene names corresponding to the rows in filtered_count_matrix.mtx
filtered_column_metadata.txt - includes cell annotations corresponding to columns in filtered_count_matrix.mtx. Cells isolated from a given individual can de identified by the corresponding projid code. Initial pre-cluster label, broad cell-type annotation, and subcluster label (as described in the paper) are given.

notfiltered_count_matrix.mtx - includes the gene-cell count matrix for 18192 genes and 80660 cells before QC filtering.
notfiltered_gene_row_names.txt - includes gene names corresponding to the rows in notfiltered_count_matrix.mtx
notfiltered_column_metadata.txt - includes cell annotations corresponding to columns in notfiltered_count_matrix.mtx



notes: count matrices are provided in sparse format.
using the package Matrix in R the data can be loaded as follow:

require(Matrix)

filtered.counts <- readMM("filtered_count_matrix.mtx")
rownames(filtered.counts) <- readLines("filtered_gene_row_names.txt")
filtered.colMetadata <- read.delim("filtered_column_metadata.txt")

notfiltered.counts <- readMM("notfiltered_count_matrix.mtx")
notfiltered.rowMeatada <- read.delim("notfiltered_gene_row_names.txt", header = F)
rownames(notfiltered.counts) <- notfiltered.rowMeatada[,2]
notfiltered.colMetadata <- read.delim("notfiltered_column_metadata.txt")
